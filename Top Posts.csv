0,AMD Fundamentals (this is nuts),"I haven't seen a post like this in a while so I hope that this serves as a reminder to anyone who's forgotten just how cheap AMD is trading at.

Sure it's nice to keep track of the day to day news and leaks, but let's not forget the fundamentals. This isn't going to be a complex DCF assessment, but just some high level napkin math based on analyst estimates.

AMD is trading, as of writing, at $82.45.

Current average analyst estimates are for $5.01 EPS in 2023.

That's a forward Price to Earnings multiple of just 16.45!

Current consensus estimates of AMD's 5-year forward compound annual growth rate (CAGR) stands at 32.80%, giving AMD a forward PEG ratio of just 0.50 (in other words, cheap). This is insane.There are very few large cap companies in as dominant a position as AMD with such a low PEG ratio. 

To put things into perspective, if AMD grows earnings 32.8% every year for the next 5 years you get $13.6 in 2026 and $18 in 2027. That translates to a PE of 6 and 4.6 respectively. Which is ironically near where Intel trades today on TTM eps (Intel's forward PE is 10). But analysts estimates for Intel's 5yr forward CAGR is just 3.24%. 

What do you think AMD's 5-yr CAGR will be in 2026/2027? I suspect that even if Intel makes a comeback to parity, AMD will still be growing at least 10% per year between 2026 and 2030. If this is the case, i think AMD could easily maintain a PE of about 20 in 2026/27, but it's trading today at just 4.5-6. I could be wrong here, but the more i think about it, the more i convince myself AMD will be worth $300+  4-5 years from now.

However to be fair, i'm not counting in my estimates any additional share dilution, but i'm also not accounting for the massive ongoing share repurchase program. Late in February AMD announced $8 Billion in buybacks in addition to the previous $4B! That's almost 10% of today's $130b market cap, and those buybacks mean more earnings and a greater compound effect from growth.

To add to that, let's not forget how previous analyst consensus estimates have fared against AMDs actual earnings and growth rates. 

[estimates vs actual](https://preview.redd.it/d1v9b3ql08691.png?width=385&format=png&auto=webp&s=d844cfba7ad04b3252d8d7da7ca9838338c4f14b)

And this is just the last 5 quarters. Needless to say, it seems highly likely that analysts current estimates of forward growth and earnings are conservative. Let's also remember that AMD's executive team have historically  given conservative guidance while repeatedly beating and raising, quarter after quarter. My random guess, is there's probably a greater than 50% chance that AMD beats all the current estimates by 10% or more, and substantially greater than 50% chance (maybe 90%+?) that AMD at least meets estimates.

Despite the macroeconomic worries over  inflation this, recession that, AMD is in a secular growth environment. Demand for AMD's chips will only increase. In fact, i bet that recession and inflation probably increases demand for AMD's chips because technology and the move to the cloud are generally deflationary by providing cost savings to businesses. And as everyone here already knows, AMD has a massive lead in performance and TCO over the competition, and with that comes pricing power. AMD's sales are only constrained by its supply of wafers from TSMC which will only grow.

So, for all the reasons mentioned above, it seems insane to me that AMD is trading at these prices. It's as if, in this macro environment, valuations don't matter anymore. But eventually things will have to turn around. I can't imagine Wall Street, the algos, and investors will let AMD trade at 16x next year's earnings for very long once it's clear that AMD is recession proof and growing 30%+ YoY. Hopefully AMD's management can show this duriung the next earnings call.

If this isn't convincing enough that AMD is deeply undervalued, i encourage you to look at the PEs and growth estimates of other big tech companies. Nvidia, one of our closest competitors, trades at 24.6x 2023 EPS estimates, while analysts expect it to grow just 22.8% in each of the next 5 years. That means if you're buying Nvidia today, you're paying 50% MORE, for 50% LESS growth! INSANE! Amazon is no different, trading at 39.5x 2023 EPS estimates with 40.5% growth. That's over 140% more expensive, for just 30% more growth. Google(Alphabet) is selling for 16.4x 2023 eps est. and has just 17% growth. That's an equal price, but you're getting nearly half of the growth that AMD offers. And so it goes for nearly every large cap tech stock. There really aren't alot of companies that offer as good a deal as AMD, with the exception perhaps of Micron.

Anyway, to anyone who has made it this far thanks for reading and i hope this has been helpful.
